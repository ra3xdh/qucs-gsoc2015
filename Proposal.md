## Qucs - Quite universal circuit simulator. Project description.

Circuit simulation software is a subclass of Electronic Design Automation 
(EDA) CAD software. There are not so many open-source EDA CAD software. The 
purpose of our organization is to create a full-functional open-source circuit 
simulator.

Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to setup a 
circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, 
small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. After that simulation has 
finished you can view the simulation results on a presentation page or window.

- Qucs, briefly for Quite Universal Circuit Simulator, is a circuit simulator 
with graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is based on Qt4. The software aims 
to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, 
Harmonic Balance analysis, noise analysis, etc.


- Qucsator, the simulation backend, is a command line circuit simulator. It 
takes a network list in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs dataset. It 
has been programmed for usage in the Qucs project but may also be used by other 
applications.

The Qucs GUI is well advanced and allows setting up schematics and presenting 
simulation results in various types of diagrams. DC, AC, S-parameter, noise and 
transient analysis is possible, mathematical equations and use of a subcircuit 
hierarchy (with parameterised subcircuits) are available. Qucs can also import 
existing SPICE models for use in your simulations.

While Qucs is well developed, we still strive to improve the project, and will 
always welcome offers of help. Qucs doesn't just need help with programming, it 
also needs graphics, high quality example schematics, tutorials for the website 
and lots more.

Qucs comes with a huge array of components and models including HICUM, BSIM2, 
BSIM3, and soon BSIM6. It also provides many semiconductor based components and 
models such as OpAmps, Diodes, MOSFETs, PMOSFETs and many more. Some example 
schematics can be found here which demonstrate some of the abilities of Qucs, 
and many more examples are provided with the program. 

## Qucs aims at GSOC-2015

We have the following aims at GSOC-2015

- Attract new developers to project
- Make Qucs development process more rapidly
- Implement new features for Qucs with help of students
- We hope that circuit simulator development participation will be useful and 
interesting for students of electronics and electrical engineering specialties.
- Contribute to open-source EDA software.

## Previous GSOC participation

We didn't ever previously take a part at GSOC. 

## Licensing

## Administrator and Mentors

Our mentors will be active Qucs developers. The list of active developers is 
available here <http://qucs.sourceforge.net/devs.html>. All of these people are 
active contributors in Qucs sources. They know project architecture very well. 
Each developer is specialized on his own part of project (for example 
simulation kernel, or GUI, or Qucs-tools). Mentors will be selected according 
proposed ideas specialization. Generally mentors will be contact persons at our 
ideas list.

Administrator is Vadim Kuznetsov <ra3xdh@gmail.com>  <https://github.com/ra3xdh>

Backup administrator is Guilherme Brondani Torri <guitorri@gmail.com> <https://github.com/guitorri>

## Disappearing students and mentors

We will request weekly reports from students on development process. 
Development process will be organized at Github, so we can track students 
commits and progress. Interaction with students will be implemented via pull 
requests at Github and E-mail. 

Mentors are our active developers. They are responsible for implementation of 
new features of Qucs. They have no plans to disappear till Septemeber 2015 (GSOC 
ending).

## Steps to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, 
during and after the program

Students will have the following benefits from our project:

- Circuit simulators are generally closed source projects. With Qucs student 
can see what is inside circuit simulator. They can learn simulation algorithms 
and how GUI interaction works. 

- Open-source CADs development is sufficient new direction in open-source 
software world. Students can use their achievements in Qucs for their B.S., 
M.S., or Ph.D thesis preparation. Students can join our development team in 
future.

- Students can improve their skills at C++, Qt, and electronics engineering.
